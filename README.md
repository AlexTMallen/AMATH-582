# Spectral, Spectrum, Sparse
I explore the techniques of singular value decomposition (spectral), fast Fourier transform (spectrum), and sparsity-promoting regularizations (sparse) in computational data analysis.

### AMATH 582 projects from winter 2021 - Computational Methods for Data Analysis.

Check out the neural coding project in `allenSDK`! I classify images of animals and natural scenes based on the neural responses they produce when shown to mice.
